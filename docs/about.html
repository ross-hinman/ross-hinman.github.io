  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p class="tab">I am a Michigan State University graduate with a degree in Interdisciplinary Studies. I took three years of engineering before changing my major so I have a foundation in math and science.</p>
  <p class="tab">After missing the techbical problem solving of engineering, I decided to switch my career path and began learning how to code to become a software developer. I am currently searching for a career in the software industry with the skills I am learning.</p>
