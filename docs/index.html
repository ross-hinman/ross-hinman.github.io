    <h2>Ross Blaine Hinman.</h2><br>
      <p class="tab">I am a recent Michigan State University graduate with a degree in Interdisciplinary studies. I have been job searching for a year and am currently looking to change my career path.
      I was recently admitted into Grand Cricus' Coding Boot Camp and am looking to get into the tech field after graduation.</p>
      <p class="tab">So far in my developing career, I have made many for-loops, while-loops, and do-loops. I have began to incorporate many of these techniques. I plan on implimenting all these new techniques to create my own projects soon.</p>
      <p class="tab">My hometown is Clinton, Michigan. It is a small village with 2 stop lights, a grocery store, and a few restaurants. It's not much, but it's where I grew up.</p>
